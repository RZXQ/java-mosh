            /*
             * Explanation of join:
             * - The join method causes the main thread to wait until the downloadThread has finished executing.
             * - When downloadThread is done, only then will the main thread resume execution.
             * - The main thread is "blocked" while waiting for downloadThread, which means it does nothing
             *   else until downloadThread completes.
             * - This is especially useful in cases where the main thread needs the result or completion
             *   of another task before proceeding.
             *
             * Potential Downside:
             * - Since the main thread is paused, if this was a UI application, the UI could appear to
             *   "freeze" until downloadThread finishes. Itâ€™s important to consider this when using join
             *   in GUI applications.
